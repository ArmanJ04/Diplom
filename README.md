# ü©∫ Cardiovascular Risk Assessment Web Application (Diploma Project)

A full-stack web application for assessing the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) using a pre-trained AI model. The system is designed for two types of users: **Patients** and **Doctors**.

## üîç Overview

Patients can enter their health data (manually or via JSON upload) to get an AI-powered risk evaluation. Doctors can view multiple patients, monitor their risk levels, and provide feedback or preventive recommendations.

The project integrates a PyTorch model (`best_model.pth`) through a Python microservice and communicates with the Node.js backend via internal API requests.
